 * Lists attendance records for the given filters via SWR.

 * a sibling envelope field that `apiFetch` does not surface, so paging is
 * driven client-side — callers advance `page` and use `hasNext` (a full page
 * was returned) to decide whether a further page exists.
 *
 * The list is role-scoped on the backend: managers/admins/checkers see every
 * record, while workers receive only their own.
